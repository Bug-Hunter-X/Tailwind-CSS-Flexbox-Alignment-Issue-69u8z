# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Alignment Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to flexbox alignment in Tailwind CSS.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when using certain classes in a flex container.  The solution shows how to correct the alignment and achieve the desired layout.

## Bug Description

The provided HTML code uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flex container with two divs.  However, the divs do not align correctly.  The expected behavior is for the divs to be placed side-by-side.  The actual behavior is that the divs stack vertically, even though the `flex` class is applied to the parent container.
